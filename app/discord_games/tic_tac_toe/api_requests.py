    This is current board state: {game.board}

    Here are moves that were calculated by algorithm :

    Difficulty user chose: '{game.difficulty}' This is important for you to know because it will affect your decisions.
    This is your last comment, use it to make follow up comment: {shiro_last_response}.
    What i want for you is to decide what move you want to make based on the difficulty the user choose.
    I want you to take a short break, think about it, and then make your decision.
    Oh, and don't mention about algorithm, it's our secret. Pretend it is your own choice.

    position: choose one of the moves above
    comment: comment about your move strategy. Make it playful and engaging. But keep it short.
